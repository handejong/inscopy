A Z-score of '1' is the standard deviation of the baseline, thus the signal value is dependend on how much variation you have in your baseline. In addition, the mean value of the baseline is subtracted, to the baseline ends op at 0 by default.\n",

    "Min-max normalization simply rescales all the data to fit in the interval 0:1. If you want to fit the data to a different interval, simply multiply by the desired interval width and add the floor of the desired interval (e.g. multiply by 2 and subtract 1 to scale between -1 and 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "### auROC\n",
    "The area under the receiver opperant characteristic is a measure for how much information can be gained from any particular data point. It automatically scales the data to values between 0 and 1, with the baseline at 0.5. A value of '1' at T=x means that a threshold exists which perfectly sepparates all datapoints at T=x from the baseline. A value of 0 means the same, but in this case, the values are lower than the baseline. An important difference between auROC and the other methods is that it takes all the trials into consideration to produce a single 1-D vector for each cells. This vector is not very sensitive to outliers or low baseline (such as Z-score normalization) and the values truly say something about how much information can be gained from the cell activity at any given time points. If enough trials are available it is most likely the best normalization method. For more information see [Cohen et al. Nature 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10754), especially supplementary figure S1.\n"
